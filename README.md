_Effective Date: March 4, 2025_

We respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle and protect your personal information in relation to your use of our Google Chrome extension, TabSense.

## Information Collection

TabSense collects limited data necessary for its core functionality:

1.  **Tab Information**: TabSense accesses your open tabs' URLs and page titles to facilitate AI-powered grouping through Clustr AI. 
    
2.  **User Preferences**: We store your custom rules and preferences (such as dark mode settings, AI toggle status, and grouping rules) locally in your browser's storage. This information never leaves your device.
    
3.  **Chrome API Usage**: TabSense uses Chrome's tabs, tabGroups, commands and storage APIs to deliver its functionality, but does not transmit any of this information to external servers.
    

No personal identifiable information is collected, stored, or transmitted to our servers or any third parties. All processing occurs locally within your browser.

## Links to Other Websites

TabSense may contain links to other websites not operated by us. This Privacy Policy does not cover how those websites process personal information. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of every website that you visit.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy, and the "Effective Date" above will be updated. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

By using TabSense, you signify your consent and agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using TabSense.
